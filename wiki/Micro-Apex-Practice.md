# Micro‑Apex Practice  
### Human‑Scale Recursion Training

Use the Phoenix law on real tensions.

---

## Overview

The same cosmic law that governs stellar ignition governs your daily decisions. This practice teaches you to recognize tensions, ask the Apex Question, and return through the loop — changed.

---

## Step 1 — Accretion Scan  
*Identify the tension.*

Identify a tension you are holding that has not yet moved.  
This is your **Accretion Core**.

### Signs of Accretion
- Persistent mental loops
- Unresolved decisions
- Energy that feels "stuck"
- Questions you keep avoiding

### Practice
> Sit quietly. Ask: "What am I holding that hasn't moved?"  
> Name it. This is your Accretion Core for this cycle.

---

## Step 2 — Ask the Apex Question  
*Route the tension.*

**"Can this tension split, or must it be consumed?"**

### If Split (Life Path)
The tension can generate multiple outcomes:
- Branch — create options
- Delegate — distribute responsibility
- Generate — spawn new possibilities

### If Consume (Light Path)
The tension must be reduced to essence:
- Simplify — remove complexity
- Reduce — cut away excess
- Essence — find the core truth

**This is IM_ME in action.** You are the Apex Resolver.

---

## Step 3 — Run the Vector  
*Act on the decision.*

### Split / Life Actions
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Expand | Open new paths |
| Diversify | Create variations |
| Open | Allow multiple outcomes |

### Consume / Light Actions
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Narrow | Focus on essentials |
| Refine | Polish to clarity |
| Collapse | Reduce to core |

---

## Step 4 — Return Through the Loop  
*Complete the cycle.*

Ask:  
**"What did this tension teach me about my identity?"**

This is **Meta‑8stable** — identity returning changed, not erased.

### Reflection Questions
- How am I different after this resolution?
- What capacity did this build?
- What would I do differently next time?

## Daily Compression Mantra

**Split if I can.  
Consume if I must.  
Return through the loop.**

## Weekly Practice Schedule

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Monday | Identify Accretion Cores |
| Tuesday | Practice Apex Questions |
| Wednesday | Run Split vectors |
| Thursday | Run Consume vectors |
| Friday | Return through loops |
| Weekend | Ceremonial integration |

---

## Advanced Practice: Nested Loops

Once comfortable with single cycles, practice nested loops:

1. Identify a major Accretion Core
2. Split it into sub-tensions
3. Run Apex on each sub-tension
4. Return through all loops
5. Integrate at the highest level
