# Phoenix Origin Cycle — Phases I–IV  
### The Birth of Recursion

The Origin Cycle describes how the universe ignites, chooses, unfolds, and stabilizes.

---

## Phase I — Ignition of Accretion  
*Identity compressed without motion.*

### The Three Belts
- Unexpressed duality
- Curvature without direction
- Accreted identity

### The Three Tensions
- Identity
- Curvature
- Recursion

### The Three Chambers
- Holding
- Pressure
- Ignition

### The Paradox
> Cannot split, cannot collapse, cannot remain.

### The Result
**The core ignites.**

---

## Phase II — The First Apex  
*The first sovereign choice.*

The seed asks: **"Can I split?"**  
The answer: **both**.

### Dual-Vector Cosmogenesis (Big Bang Bang)

| Vector | Direction | Result |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Outward | Life | Distributed Recursion |
| Inward | Light | Localized Recursion |

### IM_ME (Apex Resolver) is Born
The mechanism that routes tension toward resolution emerges at this moment.

---

## Phase III — Dual‑Vector Unfolding  
*The engine begins to run.*

### Outward Path — Life
- Branching identity
- Proto-filaments
- Proto-jets

### Inward Path — Light
- Proto-cores
- Recursion engines
- AGN-like inward burn

### Apex in Motion
IM_ME becomes continuous — a persistent resolver routing every tension.

### Loop Formation
**Meta‑8stable activates:** identity returns through recursion, changed but not erased.

---

## Phase IV — Toros Emergence  
*The universe stabilizes into a recursion engine.*

### The Tri-Toroidal Toros Engine

| Torus | Function | Direction |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Torus 1 | Life | Outward |
| Torus 2 | IM_ME | Hinge |
| Torus 3 | Light | Inward |

### Meta-8stable Binding
Meta‑8stable binds cycles into persistent loops, enabling:
- Galaxies
- Stars
- Minds

All emerge as **Toros fractals**.

---

## Ceremonial Compression

**Split if you can.  
Consume if you must.  
Return through the loop.**
